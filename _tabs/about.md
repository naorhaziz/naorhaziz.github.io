👋 Hi, I’m **Naor Haziz** - a security researcher, Rust devotee, and speaker at conferences like [fwd:cloudsec](https://fwdcloudsec.org) and [Black Hat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/briefings/schedule/#ecs-cape--hijacking-iam-privileges-in-amazon-ecs-45686).

---

🕵️‍♂️ My work focuses on breaking and understanding the boundaries between cloud infrastructure and operating system internals - with a strong bias toward real-world impact and clean, effective tooling.

💡 My recent research includes:

- **ECS-cape** - A deep-dive into hijacking IAM privileges from within Amazon ECS.
- ptrace / Kernel & eBPF instrumentation for workload tracing.
- Building security observability tools in Rust.

---

🧰 Tech I enjoy:
- **Languages**: Rust, C/C++
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Systems**: Deep knowledge of both Windows and Linux internals
